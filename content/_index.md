# Incident Management Program

We build IMPulse with engineers, for engineers — and we actually listen.

<!-- ![preview](static/preview.png) -->

Designed for DevOps, platform teams, and security-focused engineering orgs.

## Open-source. Fast. Simple. Now with Google Calendar integration!

## Why IMPulse?

| Problem | IMPulse Solution |
|:-|:-|
| Alerts go to everyone — or no one | Smart routing → right person, right time, no spam |
| Tired of bloated enterprise tools | Lightweight, clean UI, no extra noise |
| Not sure who’s on call? | Google Calendar sync shows everything at a glance |
| Need reliable Slack/Telegram alerts | Stable, tested integrations (Slack, Telegram, Mattermost) |
| Full control and customization | You own the code. Extend it as needed. |
| Need setup today, not next sprint | Deploy in minutes via Docker |
| Can’t trust black-box vendors | Fully open source, self-hosted, no data leaks |
